# Changelog

All notable changes to the Procurement Tool will be documented here.

## [Unreleased]
- Fixed: backupState() now logs a console warning if the automatic localStorage
  backup fails, instead of silently swallowing the error. Verified by simulating
  a localStorage failure and confirming the warning fires, then confirming normal
  backups still succeed silently as before.
- Fixed: order ID fallback now uses the shared uid() function instead of its
  own separate, weaker ID generation. Verified: no other code in the file
  depends on the old "ord_" prefix, and confirmed uid() produces a proper
  ID when the fallback path is triggered.

## [v1.2.2.39] - Baseline
- First version tracked in git.
- Established as the current production baseline (commit f31ed4b on main).
- No functional changes from the prior untracked v1.2.2.39 — this entry marks
  the start of proper version history, not a code change.
